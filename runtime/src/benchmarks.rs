	// `pallet_grandpa` stays out. Its benchmarks measure an internal
	// `check_equivocation_proof`, but the Config consumes a handwritten
	// trait built around `report_equivocation`, so a generated file can
	// never implement it. Upstream runtimes wire `()` here too.

	// `pallet_treasury` stays out. Its payout benchmark spends a hardcoded
	// 100 units, far below this chain's existential deposit, so the transfer
	// can never succeed. Weights stay on the upstream values.
	[pallet_bounties, Bounties]
	// `pallet_child_bounties` stays out. Its setup hardcodes a Root origin for
	// `propose_curator`, but bounty spends here run through OpenGov tracks that
	// Root does not satisfy. Weights stay on the upstream values.
